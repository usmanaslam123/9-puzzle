# 9-puzzle
This game is the 9 puzzle, coded on C++, the code aims to rearrange your array into the original sequence. It is a variant of the famous 15 puzzle
My code aims to solve the problem using recursion, but is stuck in an infinite loop.
i hope you can understand it
Update:
The reason why it's stuck in an infinite loop is because due to recursion it is stuck in a depth first recursive search instead of a BFS. I am unable to make it expand in a BFS way.
